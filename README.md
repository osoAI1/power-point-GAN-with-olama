AI Presentation Creator Pro is a fully local, privacy-focused tool that generates high-quality academic PowerPoint presentations using a local GGUF LLM (via llama.cpp). The system can optionally learn from a PDF uploaded by the lecturer and uses RAG (TF-IDF retrieval) to generate accurate, domain-specific content for every slide.
